This directory contains 2 programs allowing to perform the same operations: to access Talkmore's balance and send SMS from the desktop. One is GUI based, one is a command line version.
Both will auto store the credentials under a ~/.talkmore/credentials file, so you might want to remove that file if you stop using the program.


Required dependencies

For the CLI and GUI programs:

* httplib2

For the GUI program, you will need exta dependencies

* wx widgets (tested with v2.8 on Ubuntu 09.10)
